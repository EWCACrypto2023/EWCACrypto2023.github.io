<p>Our aim is to host a gender-inclusive event that is focused on empowering early career cryptographers who identify as women. This event will provide opportunities for networking, inspiration from successful women role models in our field, and raise awareness to the broader cryptography community of potential challenges that their peers may be encountering. We also plan to discuss how
good allyship can be an important tool to overcome these challenges.</p>
