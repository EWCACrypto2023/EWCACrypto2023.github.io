		We will annouce our call for lightning talks soon. 
	</p>
</div>	





<div style="padding-top: 20px;"></div>










<p>Our aim is to provide a fun, as well as thought provoking, experience for everyone attending through three activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span style="color:#8d7698"> Lightning talk and social activities: </span> This part of our event is intended to provide a platform for students identifying themselves as women (especially those in the start of their research careers) to present a short talk about their research. We will also plan some fun icebreaker social activities for the students to interact and get to know others in the field. </p> </li>
	
<li><p><span style="color:#8d7698"> StorySLAM: </span> This will be an inclusive event, where we have a ~2 hour session of stories/experiences (each of 10 mins) that highlight various aspects (some positive and some negative) of our community and research endeavors. We wish to initiate a wholesome discussion on diverse topics through a wide-spectrum of stories that would be inspiring, and thought-provoking for young researchers. </p> </li>

<li><p><span style="color:#8d7698"> Mentorship Lunch: </span> We will get a few senior researchers to sign up for meeting a small group of junior researchers during the lunch hours at CRYPTO. We will be circulating an excel sheet amongst all attendees later. </p> </li>
</ul>
