<h2>Mentorship Lunch</h2>

<div class="announce">
	<p>
This year we are introducing mentorship lunches. This is an opportunity for students to have lunch (in groups of 8), and interact with 2 senior cryptographers. This is intended to be an informal conversation that is not research oriented. The linked spreadsheet has the table assignments. Each table has 6 spots for students. If you're interested in participating, please sign up on the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LwsQ8-gHMZKN1ABzRadgauvGVWFGi2vfD2SFXtEpshs/edit?usp=sharing" style="color:crimson;">sheet</a>. <br><br>
		
		Since we only have slots for 6 students per table and limited tables on each day, we recommend you to sign up as soon as possible. Please refrain from filling out your name more than two times to give everyone a chance.  <br><br>
		
		On Monday and Wednesday please meet one of the RISE organizers outside the main entrance of De La Guerra (the dining hall) at 12.25 PM. For Tuesday please meet one of the RISE organizers at the same location at 12.40 PM.
