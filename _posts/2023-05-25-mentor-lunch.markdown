<h2>Mentorship Lunch</h2>

<div style="padding-top: 60px;"></div>

Similar to STOC/FOCS, we will have junior/senior lunch meet-ups Monday to Thursday during the conference. The goal is to give opportunities to young researchers in our field to interact with senior researchers. 

List of senior researchers, and a sign up sheet will be made available a few weeks before the event.
